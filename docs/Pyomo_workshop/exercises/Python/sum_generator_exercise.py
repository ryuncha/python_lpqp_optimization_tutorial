# There are 100 toucans at the pet store, but your parents will only allow you
# to bring home one. The constraint for this looks like \sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i = 1.
# Express this constraint in Pyomo:

# m = ConcreteModel()
# m.toucans = RangeSet(100)
# m.x = Var(m.toucans, domain=Binary,
#           doc="Binary variable denoting selection of a toucan.")
# m.pick_one_toucan = Constraint(expr=sum(--FILL THIS IN--) == 1)

# Answer:

m = ConcreteModel()
m.toucans = RangeSet(100)
m.x = Var(m.toucans, domain=Binary,
          doc="Binary variable denoting selection of a toucan.")
m.pick_one_toucan = Constraint(expr=sum(m.x[i] for i in m.toucans) == 1)
